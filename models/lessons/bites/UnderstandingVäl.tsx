      <h2>Language Bites</h2>
      <h3>Understanding "väl"</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      The word <i>väl</i> is another one of those words that doesn't always have
      a direct equivalent in English. It has a ton of meanings depending on the
      context, which makes it one of those words which, if you can master it,
      you will sound like a true native.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vowel sound in <i>väl</i> can be either short or long, depending on
      the meaning. Using the wrong length can change the meaning in some
      situations, so be careful when you use it, and pay attention when
      listening to others.
    </p>

    <p>Let's look at some ways to use this word.</p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">Usage 1a: "well"</h3>
    <p>
      The first usage of <i>väl</i> as an adverb means "well" as in something is
      satisfying and/or fitting for the situation. This is probably the easiest
      to understand for English speakers.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <i>väl</i> is used in this way, it is pronounced with a long vowel
      sound.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Hon spelar <strong>väl</strong>.
      <br />= She plays well.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Beskrivningen passar <strong>väl</strong> in på honom.
      <br />= The description matches him well.
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">Usage 1b: well-being or positive being</h3>
    <p>
      This is the only usage of <i>väl</i> as a noun, specifically an <i>ett</i>
      -noun. It is related to the previous usage of "well". In this case,{" "}
      <i>väl</i> means "well-being", or "what's best for someone", and it has no
      plural or definite forms.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <i>väl</i> is used in this way, it is pronounced with a long vowel
      sound.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Jag vill bara ditt <strong>väl</strong>.
      <br />= I only want what's best for you.
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">Usage 2: supposedly, presumably</h3>
    <p>
      This usage means something like <i>supposedly</i>, <i>presumably</i> but
      in a less formal way. It is used for statements that are generally
      believed to be true.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <i>väl</i> is used in this way, it is pronounced with a short vowel
      sound.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Han visste <strong>väl</strong> inte om att hon var otrogen.
      <br />= Supposedly he didn't know that she was cheating on him.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Hon blir <strong>väl</strong> frisk <strong>nån</strong> gång.
      <br />= She has to recover from her illness <strong>some</strong> day. (It
      would be weird if she didn't.)
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">Usage 3: "too"</h3>
    <p>
      The second usage of <i>väl</i> is a more formal or old-fashioned way of
      expressing "too", as in something is of a higher degree than desired. Most
      people would use the word <i>för</i> instead, but you can still sometimes
      hear this usage of <i>väl</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <i>väl</i> is used in this way, it is pronounced with a long vowel
      sound.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      <strong>väl</strong>/för stora kläder
      <br />= clothes that are too big/not fitting
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">
      Usage 4: As a filler word in some contexts
    </h3>

    <p>
      This is probably the hardest to understand or explain. In some contexts,{" "}
      <i>väl</i> has simply no meaning, but it is used as a filler word. Some
      examples of contexts could be marking a question that arises after new
      information is given or circumstances have changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <i>väl</i> is used in this way, it is pronounced with a short vowel
      sound.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Madonna är 70 år och uppträder fortfarande. Vem kunde <strong>väl</strong>{" "}
      tro det?
      <br />= Madonna is 70 years old and is still performing on stage. Who
      would have thought it?
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">Usage 5: Expressing "don't tell me"</h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to give force to questions, which are often rhetorical.
      Compare this to <i>...eller hur?</i> which is not used for rhetorical
      questions. Instead, this usage of <i>väl</i> focuses more on the speaker
      believing to be correct about something.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <i>väl</i> is used in this way, it is pronounced with a short vowel
      sound.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Du är <strong>väl</strong> inte upprörd över en sån liten sak (!)?
      <br />= Don't tell me you're upset about such a small thing!
      <br /> or: You're not upset about such a small thing, are you?
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Sluta mobba honom. Han har <strong>väl</strong> inte gjort dig något (!)?
      <br />= Stop bullying him! He hasn't done anything (bad) to you, has he?
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">
      Usage 6: Expressing a request or suggestion
    </h3>

    <p>
      When making a request or suggestion, <i>väl</i> acts as a filler like in
      Usage 3, but softens the tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <i>väl</i> is used in this way, it is pronounced with a short vowel
      sound.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Vi kan <strong>väl</strong> gå på bio?
      <br />= Why don't we go to the cinema?
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Du kan <strong>väl</strong> diska när du ätit klart?
      <br />= Could you do the dishes when you finish eating?
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">
      Usage 7: Expressing a nonchalant response
    </h3>

    <p>
      Another tricky one to translate. This usage reflects the attitude of the
      speaker being nonchalant, indecisive, or indifferent about something. It
      is not really rude but not an exciting or polite response either.
    </p>

    <p>This could very well be one of the answers to the previous question:</p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      A: Du kan <strong>väl</strong> diska när du ätit klart? <br />
      B: Det kan jag <strong>väl</strong> göra.
      <br />= I could do that. (But I'm not too happy about it.)
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div className="lesson-chunk">
    <h3 className="theme-swe-blue">
      Usage 8: after an occurrence or something
    </h3>

    <p>
      This is similar to the English word "once" when referring to something
      that happened after an event or place. It is usually used in the past
      tense in a narrative tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <i>väl</i> is used in this way, it is pronounced with a long vowel
      sound.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Vi hade problem att hitta vägen till hotellet, men <strong>väl</strong>{" "}
      framme (= när vi <strong>väl</strong> kommit fram) hade vi en fantastisk
      semester.
      <br />= We had trouble finding our way to the hotell, but once we got
      there, we had a wonderful vacation.
    </p>

    <p className="w3-margin-left">
      Den här maskinen tar tid på sig att starta, men när den{" "}
      <strong>väl</strong> kommit igång kan den sköta sig själv.
      <br />= This machine takes some time to start, but once it gets going, it
      can operate by itself.
    </p>
