      Welcome to the Language Bites section!
    </h3>

    <p>
      Language Bites are small bite-sized lessons focusing on a single word or
      grammar point that I couldn't find a suitable place for in the textbook,
      or added here as a repeat so you can quickly find the information you need.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bites are for intermediate to advanced level learners. If you are
      still a beginner learner, please read through the textbook first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the Language Bites have exercises attached to them.
