        <p>In this lesson you will learn how to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            ...identify the letters in the Swedish alphabet and the order they
            appear in.
          </li>
          <li>...pronounce the letters.</li>
          <li>
            ...write the letters on your keyboard (in the first exercise).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>,
    <div className="lesson-chunk">
      <p>
        We will start things off with the basics, and it doesn't get much more
        basic than the alphabet. The Swedish alphabet is the same as the English
        one, but we have added three extra letters tacked on the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        These three letters are Å (A with a ring on it), Ä (A with two dots on
        it), and Ö (O with two dots on it). Despite looking like A and O, they
        are not the same letters.
        <br />I repeat,{" "}
        <u>
          <em>
            <strong>they are not the same letters!</strong>
          </em>
        </u>
      </p>
      <img className="w3-image" src={"/images/aomeme.jpg"} alt="åäö meme" />

      <p>
        This means they are pronounced differently from A and O. We will see
        more about them soon.
      </p>
    </div>,
    <div className="lesson-chunk">
      <h4 className="theme-swe-blue">The alphabet</h4>
      <p>Let's look at the alphabet in its entirety.</p>
      <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
        {LETTERS_OF_ALPHABET.split("").map((letter) => (
          <span
            className="w3-show-inline-block w3-padding-small"
            key={letter}
            style={{
              color: VOWELS.includes(letter) ? "red" : "black"
            }}
          >
            {letter}&nbsp;
          </span>
        ))}
      </div>
      You can listen to all of the letters in the recording here{" "}
      <AudioButton fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/alphabet.mp3" />, or on
      individual letters in the following sections.
      <p>
        I have marked the vowels in red for clarity. Notice that unlike English,{" "}
        <strong>Y is always a vowel in Swedish</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vowels are also special because they can be pronounced in two ways,
        i.e. a long and a short version. When you spell out a word or name, you
        will use the long versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When listening to the recordings{" "}
        <IfMobile>in the next section</IfMobile>
        <IfDesktop>in the section below</IfDesktop>, pay attention to how the
        long and short versions differ.
        <br />
        Also, please note that this is how the pronunciations here follow the
        Standard Swedish ("rikssvenska") dialect, and there are tons of local
        dialects which may differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, there are many words where the spelling does not match the
        pronunciation. I will get back to that in the next lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will teach you how to pronounce the vowels first, as we use them to
        build the sounds of the consonants later.
      </p>
    </div>,
    <div className="lesson-chunk">
      <h4 className="theme-swe-blue">Vowels</h4>
      <p>Letters in brackets [] indicate IPA notation.</p>
      <h5>A [ɑː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/a-long.mp3"
          label="A (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        The long version of A is a low back vowel and similar to the British
        pronunciation of <i>father</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/a-short.mp3"
          label="A (short)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of the word <i>hut</i> or <i>must</i> in English.
      </p>

      <h5>E [eː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/e-long.mp3"
          label="E (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>Sounds like the French é without the glide.</p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/e-short.mp3"
          label="E (short)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Like e in many words in English such as <i>let</i>, <i>elephant</i> or{" "}
        <i>bread</i>. In some words, it's similar to the short Ä (see below).
      </p>

      <h5>I [iː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/i-long.mp3"
          label="I (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        A high ee sound in English, like in <i>see</i> and <i>meet</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/i-short.mp3"
          label="I (short)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the short I in English, found in words like <i>hit</i> and{" "}
        <i>ship</i>.
      </p>

      <h5>O [uː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/o-long.mp3"
          label="O (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of the oo in words like <i>food</i> and <i>cool</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/o-short.mp3"
          label="O (short Å)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        In the vast majority of words the short O is pronounced like Å (see
        below), and the recording reflects this. However, you may encounter some
        rare words where it is pronounced like a short version of O.
      </p>
    </div>,
    <div className="lesson-chunk">
      <h5>U [ʉː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/u-long.mp3"
          label="U (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        This one is tricky. Try to say <i>you</i> in English without the "y"
        sound, and move your upper lips around like you're about to kiss.
        <br />
        Make sure you don't drop the tone or it will sound like an O.
      </p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/u-short.mp3"
          label="U (short)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>The short U sounds like a loose and less round sound of the long U.</p>

      <h5>Y [yː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/y-long.mp3"
          label="Y (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        This is like the German Ü. Try to round your lips like you're about to
        say o but with an ee sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/y-short.mp3"
          label="Y (short)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        A short, clipped version of the long Y. Remember that Y is always a
        vowel in Swedish.
      </p>

      <h5>Å [oː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/å-long.mp3"
          label="Å (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever you do, do not pronounce this as an A as it is more closer to
        O. Try to say the o in <i>home</i> without the glide.
      </p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/å-short.mp3"
          label="Å (short)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>A short, clipped version of the long Å.</p>

      <h5>Ä [ɛː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/ä-long.mp3"
          label="Ä (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever you do, do not pronounce this as an A. It is more similar to E,
        but a better way to describe it is the sound of a in words like{" "}
        <i>air</i> or the American pronunciation of <i>fast</i>.<br />Ä is not
        as long as E and has no glide.
      </p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/å-short.mp3"
          label="Å (short E)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        You can pronounce this as a short E, like in <i>let</i>.
      </p>

      <h5>Ö [øː]</h5>
      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/ö-long.mp3"
          label="Ö (long)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Same as German Ö. Whatever you do, do not pronounce this as an O.
        <br />
        Try to think of the vowel sounds in words like <i>earth</i> or{" "}
        <i>myrrh</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that although Ö has the IPA symbol ø for its pronunciation, the
        Swedish language
        <i>does not</i> have this as a letter - Danish and Norwegian does,
        however. In those languages, it represents the same sound as the Swedish
        Ö.
      </p>

      <p>
        <AudioButton
          fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/ö-short.mp3"
          label="Ö (short)"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        You can pronounce this as French e in <i>le</i>.
      </p>
    </div>,
    <div className="lesson-chunk">
      <h4 className="theme-swe-blue">Consonants</h4>
      <p>
        Most of the consonants differ in pronunciation to English when read as
        letters alone. However, you can think of them as having an initial sound
        and a vowel sound. The initial sound will be similar to English in most
        cases, and the vowel sound will be same as the long version one of the
        vowels you just saw.
      </p>
      <p>
        The letters in brackets [] is an IPA pronunciation guide. If you listen
        to the recordings, you will see that the sounds coincide with the vowels
        you saw in the previous sections. Thus, if you find the consonants
        difficult, you may want to go back to review the vowels a couple of
        times.

        Can be pronounced as J (see below) in some words. I will talk about this
        more in the next lesson.

        <AudioButton fileName="lessons/the-alphabet/r.mp3" label="R [ærː]" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably the most difficult consonant to pronounce. Try to put your
        tongue in your upper mouth after you say the initial [æ] sound and move
        the tongue towards your front teeth. If done correctly, you should feel
        the tongue vibrating (so called alveolar trill).

        Pronounced like "dubbel-v" where <i>dubbel</i> means "double", and note
        that it's not "double-u" like in English.
        <br />
        Only used in names and loan words, although you can hear a slight w
        sound in some words which are spelled with v when people are speaking
        with northern Swedish accents.
